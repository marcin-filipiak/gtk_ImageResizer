# gtk_ImageResizer

## Overview

**Image Resizer** is a GTK-based desktop application written in C for resizing multiple `.jpg` images in a specified directory. The program allows users to select an image folder, choose a resizing option, and process images in the background, displaying progress and logs in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Folder Selection**: Browse and select a directory containing `.jpg` images.
- **Resize Options**: Choose from four predefined image sizes:
  - Photograph (Height: 1200px)
  - Article (Height: 600px)
  - Thumbnail (Height: 200px)
  - Icon (Height: 50px)
- **Real-time Progress**: Updates a progress bar as images are resized.
- **Log Output**: Displays resizing details in a scrollable text view.
- **Threaded Processing**: Runs image resizing in a separate thread to keep the UI responsive.
